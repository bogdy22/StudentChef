# Team Project for Y16
This is the GitLab repository for the Y16 group project.
**Important: please remember to work on your own seperate branch!**
Use:
```
git checkout -b branchToCreate
```
to make a branch and commit your changes normally. Then when you're done type
```
git checkout master
git merge branchToCreate
```
If there are merge conflicts put them on the group chat and we can talk it through.
